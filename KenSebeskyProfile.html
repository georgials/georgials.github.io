	<p> <h1> The Working Musician </h1> 
	<p> Ken Sebesky once spent five months working in the shipping department of a lingerie company. He worked at a deli in his native New Jersey where, upon the request of one of his regular customers, he would make a ham sandwich with butter on both slices of bread. He also spent one Christmas season at a fruit basket warehouse, stacking apples and pears and oranges and wrapping them in cellophane. He claims to have been awful at it. </p>
	<p> “It’s kind of been my plan from the beginning to find a way to pay my bills and then just keep on playing the guitar,” he said. “I never had any doubt that I was going to be a lifelong guitarist and a lifelong musician.” </p>
	<p> Ken’s passion for music can be traced back to an early memory of himself at seven years old, improvising on the household piano. Still earlier than that, he recalled being a fan of the Beatles, as evidenced by several photographs of him and his younger brother, Kevin, wearing sweatshirts devoted to the British boy band. As the eldest son of two professional musicians - his mother a jazz vocalist, his father a respected orchestrator and arranger - Ken became enamored by their chosen field of work, an appreciation that was further enhanced when he was gifted a Danelectro Coral Hornet guitar and amplifier for his eleventh birthday. </p>
	<p> “I really feel that when the guitar is in my hands, I can hear my musical voice,” Ken said. “It seems like I keep coming back to jazz as a way to express myself.” </p>
	<p> Now a professional jazz guitarist, Ken holds the genre in high regard, citing its collaborative nature, as well as its ability to defy notions of traditional musical structure as its main attraction. </p>
	<p> “It’s nice when I get to perform with my colleagues because we kind of reinforce each other’s good points, we mirror back to each other that we’re all musicians of a certain ilk, that we’re actually good,” he laughed. “The fact that I can make music with complete strangers in the moment, I take pride in that.”
	Aside from his more professional endeavors, Ken routinely schedules jam sessions with his friends on the weekends, occasionally fields requests to bring his guitar to family gatherings and New Year’s Day parties, and can most often be found riffing absentmindedly in his living room at the end of the day, letting the blue glow of the evening news accompany him. </p>
 	<p> Ken’s music collection rests on a set of disorganized shelves in this same room, leaving just enough space for his beloved cat, Iggy, to weave himself in and out of. Vinyl LPs, CDs, and cassettes make up the entirety of the assortment - he listens to everything from John Coltrane and Miles Davis to Yes, Led Zeppelin, and Coldplay. Several guitars sealed in anonymous black cases line the space. They are played in constant rotation, serving as the vehicle for improvised melodies, jazz standards, and whatever else he has been asked to play at an upcoming event or Christmas party. “I like mixing new styles,” he said, “like rock and jazz, or blues and jazz.” </p>
	<p> This affinity for musical collage -  a blending of hard-earned scales and easy-going, improvisational wit - is evident on his 2005 album, Hero’s Highway. Comprised of eight instrumental tracks, the entire album was composed in a three-month span about half a year prior to its recording. </p>
	<p> “I acquired a multi-track digital recorder that helped me a lot then, and I started recording my ideas,” Ken said. “I made it a point to come back the day after any idea came up and add to it, and pretty soon I was just immersed in the whole process.” </p>
	<p> In order to completely devote himself to writing music, Ken had to put everything else aside, including having to turn away a lot of other paid performance jobs. “It was a real burst of creative energy,” he said. “I was enjoying the process so much and knew that I had to complete it, so I just really absorbed myself in the whole thing.” </p>
	<p> The album’s leading track, “The Breakthrough,” reflects this message. Ken’s leading guitar embraces a unique musical structure, often mimicking that of a vocal melody - not only is it memorable, but singable. The abundant use of percussion instruments throughout the piece provide a more literal embodiment of the concept of a “breakthrough,” accentuating melodic resolutions to a satisfying end. While the guitar is undoubtedly the main focus of “The Breakthrough” - the main focus of the entire album, even - the diversified instrumentation of the piece does not go amiss. Ken’s own picking, supported by a steady bass line, engages in a cooperative back and forth exchange with the piano, giving the piece its full, lush quality. </p>
	<p> Alternatively, the title track takes a more laid back approach - the featured instruments meld together, immersing themselves in their own collective sound. Each line serves to increase the drive of the entire piece - a musical relay race, of sorts - punctuated by the same percussive elements and serenading lead guitar that characterizes the album as a whole. As “Hero’s Highway” builds in intensity, Ken takes an intricate solo, which, full of distortion and wailing high notes fit for a rock ballad, never feels out of place here. It is part of his own self-described genre: instrumental jazz-rock. </p>
	<p> Since the release of Hero’s Highway, Ken has has found success as a piano tuner, an occupation originally taken on to supplement his income. Now his main source of work, he hasn’t been able to devote as much time to writing music and playing the guitar as he once had. </p>
	<p> “It’s a little bit of a double-edged sword, having success with the piano tuning, which I have come to enjoy - it’s a good part of my life,” he said. “One of the things I look forward to when I get around to making my second CD is remembering everything I learned from making the first one. The whole process of being your own producer and composer and arranger is very time consuming,” he said. “I think I would prefer to enlist help in terms of the overseeing and production of the project.” </p>
	<p> Hero’s Highway was far from Ken’s first recording experience, however, a background that was founded when his father brought his middle school band - Marshmallow Steamshovel - to a recording studio to track an album when Ken was thirteen. The band played mostly covers, featuring songs by the likes of Cream and The Rolling Stones. </p>
	<p> “This place not only recorded on tape, but then they actually pressed it to vinyl right there,” Ken said of the recording studio in Bound Brook, New Jersey. “It wasn’t my dad’s favorite music, but I don’t think he would have gone through all the trouble to record us if he didn’t know we were pretty good,” he laughed.
	Ken’s father, Don Sebesky, is an acclaimed composer and arranger, who throughout his career has worked with artists ranging from Chet Baker and Wes Montgomery to members of the New York Philharmonic, Barbara Streisand, and Tony Bennett. He has also received several Grammy, Tony, and Drama Desk awards throughout his nearly sixty-year career. In regard to any pressure to live up to his father’s name, Ken said it could be difficult at times, but was ultimately grateful for the opportunities that allowed them to work together. </p>
	<p> “At the time, he was very busy getting hired to write original music for jingles for TV and radio commercials,” he said, “I would do at least one a month from 1980 to 1987 or so. It was seven years of a lot of work, recording with him.”
	“It was a little intimidating to work for him at first. It took me about ten years to get to the point where I started to feel relaxed,” Ken added, laughing. </p>
	 <p> Aside from growing up in a musical family, he attributed his success as a young musician to good timing: “I was able to get in on the business when it was really cooking,” he said. At age 19, after a short stint at the Berklee College of Music and later the University of Miami, Ken was offered a role in a band playing lounge gigs five nights a week, getting paid $50 a night. </p>
	<p> “The college world and learning music in that setting just felt so foreign to me,” he explained. In reference to today’s aspiring music students, he offered the same advice he followed when deciding to start pursuing work instead of a degree, saying “If someone finds their voice early on, they probably don’t need music school. There are certainly many good things about music school, but it’s not the only way to become a musician.” </p>
	<p> Ken took the job, as well as several others of a similar nature, which lead to a more enduring position in wedding bands, a demand for which started to increase steadily in the early 80s. </p>
	<p> “I started using that money to make a living and then playing the music I really wanted to play on top of that,” he said. “It was two things going on at once.” </p>
<p> Despite the bad reputation that comes along with being part of a wedding band (something having to do with playing “Sweet Caroline” one too many times), Ken noted that he was occasionally given the opportunity to play music more to his liking during these gigs - music that was more representative of his jazz background and technical prowess. “My most memorable and enjoyable performances probably happened on those jobs because I did so many of them and I was lucky enough to always have really good musicians on those bands,” he said. “We had moments where I felt that I was really playing my best.” </p>
	<p> As Ken’s career reaches the 40-year mark, he admitted that the infiltration of the music industry by the digital technology revolution of recent decades has made being a working musician a little tougher. Music has undoubtedly become more of a commodity since the age of lounge bands and television jingles - it is easier to produce, specialized roles in the industry have become more condensed, and just about anyone with talent and access to a computer arguably has the potential for success in the industry. </p>
	<p> “It’s probably impossible to not be jaded in certain ways,” Ken said. “That being said, it’s important not to get too absorbed in where music is in the entertainment world. If you really do care about writing or playing or expressing yourself in any way musically, your position in the marketplace can’t be the only thing you think about.” </p>
	<p> He was careful to avoid the all too commonly employed trope that devalues the musicianship of the current generation, deeming it somehow inferior to that which came before it. If anything, Ken seemed excited about what the future holds for young musicians. </p>
	<p> “I think we have yet to see what the next big thing is going to be in terms of musical styles. The one thing I keep listening for is good songwriting, that for me is the most important aspect of any type of music, the quality of the writing,” he said. </p>
	<p> As for any role Ken himself might play in this transitional age, he maintained that  monetary success has never been his main concern as a musician. Noting music’s shift toward becoming an increasingly youth-driven business, he mentioned that his long tenure in the industry has afforded him the luxury of being able to take some of the pressure off. “I’m going to make music more rewarding for myself if I just really appreciate the whole process of writing and recording and performing for its own sake, as opposed to worrying about how much money it generates,” he said. </p>
	<p> If anything has remained the same over the past several decades, it has been Ken’s complete love of and devotion to the maintenance of his skill. He may tune as many as four or five pianos on an average weekday, but he can still be found relaxing on his couch at the end of the day, practicing the guitar. </p>
	<p> “It’s so much a part of me that it has become just part of my daily routine to pick up the guitar and make sure that I feel comfortable playing the instrument,” Ken said. 	“That’s the constant in my life,” he added, laughing, “the guitar.” </p>
