			<p class= "article"> Alana Perez was in high school when she first took notice of a deep-seated sense of sadness and discomfort, a feeling she did not yet have the words to put a name to. This feeling made itself known in just about all social situations - while she was hanging out with friends, going to class, even spending time with family. It would rise up unexpectedly, from some hidden cavern in her gut, and fog up her chest, her throat, the roof of her mouth, initiating an undeniable desire to break down and withdraw from her surroundings. </p>
			<p class= "article"> “I didn’t know what was wrong with me, but I knew something was wrong with me,” said the now-20-year-old. “It was after years of enduring and becoming so frustrated that I decided with my mom that I should see a therapist.” </p>
			<p class= "article"> Perez has been attending regular talk therapy sessions with a specialist in New York City for three years now, something she would not have had access to if her family insurance didn’t cover the cost of psychiatric care. She has since been diagnosed with depression and a panic disorder, which she regulates with the help of medication. </p>

			<p class= "article"> <blockquote> “I think it’s the city’s responsibility to make those opportunities available to everyone,” she said, careful to note that not all who seek mental health assistance in New York City actually receive it. </blockquote> </p>
			<p class= "article"> It was with this same mentality that Mayor Bill de Blasio and First Lady Chirlane McCray developed their platform for mental health reform, something that became a major talking point in this year’s mayoral election. Supporters of the mayor have praised the program - known as ThriveNYC - for its comprehensive approach to mental health reform, welcoming people dealing with all kinds of mental illness (even in its mildest forms) to take advantage of the city’s initiative. It is this same quality of the ThriveNYC program, however, that has earned de Blasio a fair amount of criticism from his opponents, including the former Republican nominee in this year’s election for mayor, Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis. </p>
			<p class= "article"> Under Mayor deBlasio, ThriveNYC works to train community leaders to better help their community’s mental health needs, places mental health specialists in public schools to identify and treat early symptoms of mental illness, and creates a network of existing treatment centers to make assistance more accessible to those who would ordinarily have a difficult time finding reliable help. </p>
			<p  class= "article"> “Current programs designed to help mentally ill individuals do not target the severely mentally ill who are most likely to become homeless, hospitalized, incarcerated and create a danger for themselves, the public and the police,” Malliotakis argued at a debate event late last month. She, along with several other critics of the ThriveNYC initiative, have claimed that in dedicating resources to all of the 20% of New Yorkers who deal with some form of mental illness in any given year, those struggling with what Malliotakis has described as “serious illnesses,” including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, will not receive adequate care.  </p>
 			<p class= "article"> While on the campaign trail, Malliotakis vowed to divert funds from ThriveNYC (which currently has an unprecedented budget of $818 million under the de Blasio administration) to unspecified initiatives that would help those struggling with severe mental disorders engage productively as members of their communities as well as avoid negative encounters with law enforcement officials. </p>
			<p class= "article"> “[Malliotakis’ stance] is extremely problematic” said Perez, “It’s perpetuating the idea that people with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia are violent, which is part of the stigma that these people have to deal with every day.” </p>
			<p class= "article"> ***TK Interview with someone from the Mental Health Association of New York City, a non-profit organization that provide assistance and crisis intervention services to people dealing with mental health issues.*** </p>
			<p class= "article"> While the stigma of violent behavior characterizes the felt realities of individuals dealing with severe forms of mental illness, one of Malliotakis’ repeated campaign claims - one that still exists on her website - was that many of the mentally ill New Yorkers that “the de Blasio administration has refused to treat end up incarcerated in city jails.” </p>
			<p class= "article"> <blockquote> A 2014 report conducted by the mayor’s Task Force on Behavioral Health and Criminal Justice System suggests that there may be some truth to this claim - despite decreasing incarceration rates of New Yorkers overall, incarceration rates of mentally ill individuals has gone up in recent years, from 29% of all inmates in 2010 to 38% in 2014. </blockquote> </p>

			<p class= "article"> In response to these findings, the de Blasio administration launched a training program that would ideally help law enforcement officials identify signs of potential mental or behavioral disturbances and direct residents to treatment facilities, rather than prisons. While not explicitly related to the growing imprisonment rates of mentally ill New Yorkers, the ThriveNYC initiative  was established the year following the aforementioned report. </p>
			<p class= "article"> “Knowing about the availability of these mental health professionals should be easier,” Perez said about the lack of public knowledge that exists around free public health services, “There needs to be a place like a website or a phone number where people who need help know there’s someone to guide them.” </p>

Web.” initiative managed by the Mental Health Association of New York City that allows individuals experiencing a mental health crisis or looking for a live person for instant support to contact trained individuals via phone, text, or online chat.*** </p>
